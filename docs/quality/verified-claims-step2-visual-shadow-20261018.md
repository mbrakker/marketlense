# MarketLense — Verified Claims Step 2 Visual Shadow Evidence

**Date:** 2026-10-18
**Branch:** `codex/fix-retained-insight-evidence-validation`
**Step 1 comparison baseline:** `953555f`
**Prior Step 2 regression commit:** `1e966def`
**Frozen manifest SHA-256:** `744de32ef0d200ced0904b4f44868084b29e4d923f75e78ca106c3c3549d22a7`
**Status:** **PARTIAL**

## Scope and decision

Step 2 remains shadow-only. It does not overwrite retained artifacts, promote a
corrected claim, change publication readiness, regenerate downstream artifacts,
or write to WordPress. Step 3 visual factualisation and canonical
verified-claim persistence remain unstarted.

This correction restores visual inspection of retained DocMap-only pages as
provisional context, while removing the unsafe Step 2-time rebinding of
candidate/final insight evidence. A DocMap section ID or page can be inspected
by the model, but it is not promoted to a canonical finding or authoritative
evidence binding. The live result is therefore evidence about Step 2 correction
and verification, not fresh Step 1 candidate-selection evidence.

## Root causes fixed

Commit `1e966def` introduced two coupled regressions:

1. `bind_artifact_evidence_spans()` could replace a retained DocMap locator
   with a finding ID during normal artifact normalization and during replay.
   The proposition/token heuristic could bypass missing fidelity approval and
   mutate retained evidence IDs, pages, excerpts, and factual context.
2. The visual generator rejected a claim whenever all supplied spans came from
   `doc_map`, so the model could not inspect the retained provisional page.

The fix removes that Step 2 rebinding path and keeps the original binding
unchanged. The visual generator now renders the complete retained physical
page when its source identity, page, span, PDF hash, and evidence metadata are
internally consistent. DocMap-only evidence is recorded as
`provisional_page_inspection` with `canonical_promotion: false). Conflicting
source identity, page, evidence ID, or malformed span metadata still fails
closed. Existing source/PDF, evidence-fidelity, and validation boundaries are
reused; no new service, LLM stage, or persistence path was added.

The verification prompt and deterministic response handling now also require
source-grounded explanatory notes and reject a final claim that merely
restates a section heading. The original claim remains analytical direction,
not factual authority; the final corrected claim is evaluated.

## Provider-free frozen-five replay

Command:

`python scripts/quality/replay_verified_claims_step2.py --provider-free --output out/verified_claims_step2_provider_free_final_20261018/report.json`

The replay used retained real-report PDFs and artifacts without a model,
fabricated fixtures, publication state, or canonical-claim writes.

| Report | PDF pages | SHA-256 | Retained claims | Theme slots | Reference variants |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Capgemini Research Institute | 82 | matched | 5 | 5 | 9 |
| Activate | 140 | matched | 7 | 7 | 11 |
| KPMG | 42 | matched | 5 | 5 | 7 |
| Reuters Institute | 47 | matched | 6 | 6 | 8 |
| Adjust | 41 | matched | 6 | 6 | 4 |
| **Total** | — | **5/5** | **29** | **29/29** | **39** |

The retained IDs, public wording, evidence IDs, physical pages, spans,
protected factual fields, metric-spine inputs, and key-figure inputs were not
changed. This confirms input preservation and coverage, not fresh-selection
quality.

## Frozen GPT-6 Luna High replay

Command:

`python scripts/quality/replay_verified_claims_step2.py --live --output out/verified_claims_step2_live_final_20261018/report.json`

The run used the exact five hash-matched PDFs, complete original pages at
216 DPI, `gpt-6-luna`, High reasoning, independent correction and
verification calls, and the existing bounded two-attempt paths.

| Evaluation set | Verified first pass | Verified after retry | Verified total | Unresolved | Failed | Skipped | Input |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Reference variants | 38 | 0 | 38 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 39 |
| Real retained shortlist | 16 | 6 | 22 | 6 | 1 | 0 | 29 |
| **All claims** | **53** | **6** | **60** | **7** | **1** | **0** | **68** |

The reference gate matched **39/39** expected terminal outcomes with **0 false
accepts** and **0 false rejects**. `ADJ-001-unsupported-metric` was accepted
only after direct review of PDF page 19 showed that the final install/session
claim was source-supported and relevant to the original gaming-performance
direction. `ACT-004-wrong-page` remained unresolved; the model did not use a
different page to bypass the supplied physical-page binding.

Counts are mutually exclusive terminal outcomes. A retry success is counted
once in `verified_after_retry`, not again as a first-pass or separate
verified result. The sole failed row was the KPMG buyer-platform claim, whose
heading-only correction did not receive substantive source-grounded
verification evidence. The Capgemini human-support row terminated unresolved
after the deterministic heading-only claim check. The Adjust finance claim
was corrected on retry to state the source-supported LATAM +57% versus APAC
+50% session comparison.

Measured run data:

- Provider calls: **294**; input tokens: **4,431,510**; output tokens:
  **172,910**.
- Estimated cost: **$0.529617**; wall time: **1,217.198 seconds**.
- Full-page renders: **90**; cache enabled. Fresh-run cache reuse was not
  measured, so no cache-efficiency claim is made.
- Source PDFs: **5/5** expected hashes matched.
- No provider failure, canonical-claim mutation, publication write, or
  WordPress write occurred.

## Eight previously unresolved source-binding rows

The eight rows reported by the previous evaluation were not patched
individually. Their common defect was treating broad DocMap navigation/context
IDs as canonical factual evidence or allowing the replay to rebind them.

| Report / stable ID | Retained provisional binding | Root cause at the boundary | Corrected handling |
|---|---|---|---|
| Capgemini `consumer-control-of-ai` | `ai-consumers-trusted-guide`, p.30 | Related finding had no fidelity-supported source reference. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |
| Capgemini `digital-assistants-engagement-recommendation` | `recommendations`, p.46 | Related finding was unsupported/ambiguous. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |
| Activate `activate-digital-assistant-access-forecast` | `s4`, pp.18, 26, 30 | No authoritative proposition-compatible finding was retained. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |
| KPMG `buyer-standalone-platform-access` | `portfolio-simplification-as-a-value-creation-strategy`, p.18 | Same-section material was not an equivalent, fidelity-approved binding. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |
| Reuters `ai-search-platform-relationships` | `answer-engines-and-traffic`, p.10 | Nearby search-traffic material was a different proposition. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |
| Reuters `distinctive-content-response` | `content-strategies-distinctiveness`, p.15 | Related finding was not fidelity-supported. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |
| Reuters `newsroom-ai-uses-and-oversight` | `latest-tales-ai-newsroom`, p.30 | Related finding was not fidelity-supported. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |
| Reuters `subscription-membership-priority` | `business-models-and-innovation`, p.36 | Related finding was not fidelity-supported. | Provisional page inspection; no promotion. |

This correction does not claim that those eight pages support their original
propositions. It preserves their source identity and page for provisional
inspection and fails closed when correction cannot establish a supported final
claim.

## Real shortlist ledger

The replay JSON contains the complete original/corrected claim payload,
protected fields, evidence spans, request metadata, and per-attempt notes. The
ledger below records the observable before/after binding and terminal reason.
`retained` means an existing source-bound finding was left unchanged;
`provisional_page_inspection` means the retained DocMap locator was used only
for visual context and was not promoted.

## Independent factual/editorial review

- Direct text extraction from the retained original PDFs spot-checked the
  changed cases: Capgemini p.9 contains the 62% October 2025 / 64% November
  2024 deal-search values; KPMG p.18 is a section-cover page containing only
  the portfolio-simplification heading; and Adjust pp.34–35 explicitly show
  LATAM at +57% finance-session growth versus APAC at +50%, with LATAM at
  +76% install growth.
- No retained artifact was mutated and no provisional binding was promoted.
- The two canonical Capgemini findings preserved their source-supported values,
  populations, periods, and evidence IDs. The online-deal 62%/64% comparison
  survived correction; the absence of a safe structured metric binding remains
  documented rather than filled speculatively.
- The 22 verified real claims were reviewed for values, labels, cohorts,
  populations, denominators, geography, period, forecast/observed status, and
  qualitative defensibility. The two rejected real corrections were not
  counted as verified.
- The heading-only Capgemini and KPMG rewrites were rejected. The verification
  prompt permits defensible commercial interpretation, but requires an
  observed relationship, bounded pattern, or source-supported explanation; it
  does not require literal source wording.
- The 39 reference variants remained a separate regression gate. Their
  outcome match is not treated as a substitute for editorial review of every
  real corrected sentence.

## Regression verification

Passed in this worktree:

- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_artifact_evidence_binding.py tests/test_artifact_normalization_source_fidelity.py tests/test_artifact_insight_shortlisting.py` — **50 passed**.
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_verified_claims_visual_generator.py tests/test_verified_claims_step2_replay.py` — **23 passed**.
- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_artifact_generator.py tests/test_report_regeneration_generator.py tests/test_report_regeneration_identity_and_failures.py` — **228 passed**.
- Provider-free frozen-five replay — **passed**; 15 cases, 39 variants, 5/5 hashes, 29 retained claims, 29/29 theme slots, no fabricated fixtures.
- `python -m compileall -q src/generators/artifact_normalization.py src/generators/verified_claims_visual_generator.py scripts/quality/replay_verified_claims_step2.py` — **passed**.

The focused regressions cover removal of automatic DocMap rebinding,
provisional page inspection, missing-fidelity and lexical-overlap abstention,
source-page/hash conflicts, malformed/empty render inputs, typed non-retryable
failures, continuation after a failed claim, bounded retries, substantive
qualitative notes, heading-only rewrites, stable IDs, protected fields, and
cache behavior.

The repository type check remains a pre-existing failure with seven mypy
errors at unchanged lines in the parent branch; no type baseline was changed.
The remaining validation and CI checks are recorded with their exact results
in the delivery message and must not be represented as passed here until run.

## Remaining limitations and Step 3 verdict

- This is a retained-artifact replay, not fresh Step 1 generation. It does not
  prove candidate recall, selection diversity, or repeated-run stability.
- Six real claims remain unresolved and one failed verification. This is
  intentionally fail-closed; no unsupported claim is promoted.
- DocMap-only pages remain provisional inspection context. The frozen retained
  corpus does not provide canonical direct finding bindings for most selected
  claims, so this work does not establish upstream source-binding completeness.
- Capgemini online-deal numeric content is preserved in the corrected shadow
  claim but still lacks a safe structured Step 1 metric binding; speculative
  enrichment remains excluded.
- Shadow results remain non-authoritative and are not passed to regeneration or
  publication readiness.

**Verdict: PARTIAL.** Step 2 source identity checks, provisional-page handling,
typed errors, retry bounds, final-claim evaluation, qualitative grounding
requirements, and reference-benchmark correctness are implemented and
regression-tested. Step 3 cannot safely begin until canonical direct source
bindings and fresh selection evidence are available. Step 1/Step 2 live
selection effectiveness remains unproven.
