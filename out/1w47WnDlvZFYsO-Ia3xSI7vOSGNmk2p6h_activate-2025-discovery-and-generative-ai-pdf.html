  <h2>TL;DR</h2>
  <p>Generative AI is rapidly reshaping online discovery, already able to address up to 60% of searches. U.S. adults who begin searches on dedicated AI platforms are projected to grow from 15M in 2024 to 36M by 2028 (26% CAGR). Users increasingly substitute AI for exploration (68%) and direct inquiries (62%), less so for navigation (32%). Full disruption of gated content and transactions will lag due to licensing, payments, and trust requirements.</p>

  <h2>5 Insights</h2>
  <ol class="insights">
    <li>Generative AI can already address up to 60% of searches, with the remaining 40% expected to become addressable as ecosystems expand from open web discovery into gated content and transaction layers.</li><li>15M U.S. adults currently start online searches on a dedicated generative AI platform; this is forecast to reach 36M by 2028 (2024–2028E CAGR: 26%).</li><li>Among monthly users of both gen-AI and traditional search, 68% use gen-AI for exploration, 62% for direct inquiry, and 32% for navigation—indicating strong substitution for research-style queries.</li><li>Across nine use cases, monthly generative AI usage spans roughly 29–44% (e.g., learning, recommendations, writing, summarization, translation); the extract does not clearly map each precise percentage to each use case (uncertainty acknowledged).</li><li>Disruption of gated content and transactions hinges on partnerships/licensing with publishers and on capabilities like payments and product authenticity verification plus consumer acceptance, slowing displacement of traditional search in these areas.</li>

  <h2>Commentary</h2>
  <p>For brands, the rise of AI-led discovery means optimizing for answer engines (structured data, authoritative content, and licensing where applicable) becomes as critical as classic SEO. Expect lower organic clicks from traditional SERPs as AI summaries satisfy queries; retool attribution to capture AI-originated assistance and refine ROAS baselines. Test paid and partner opportunities within AI assistants, and ensure product feeds, pricing, and reviews are machine-readable to influence AI recommendations. For gated content owners, weigh licensing versus tighter access to preserve value, and for commerce, prepare for AI-mediated transactions with robust verification and payment integrations to protect conversion and measurement fidelity.</p>
