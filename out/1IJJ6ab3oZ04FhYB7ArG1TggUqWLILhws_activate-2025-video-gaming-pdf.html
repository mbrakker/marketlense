  <h2>Commentary</h2>
  <p>For brands and performance marketers, the center of gravity is mobile: it already represents the majority of game revenue and is set to grow fastest through 2028, making it the most scalable channel for incremental reach and ROAS. Creative and measurement should be mobile-first (e.g., optimizing for in‑app events and LTV), while console/PC can be leveraged for high‑impact integrations tied to established franchises—where purchase intent clusters. Expect regional revenue expansion mainly outside the U.S., underscoring the need for localized creatives and privacy‑resilient attribution. Given franchise dominance, IP partnerships and sequel‑aligned launches can boost conversion efficiency and predictability in media mix models.</p>
