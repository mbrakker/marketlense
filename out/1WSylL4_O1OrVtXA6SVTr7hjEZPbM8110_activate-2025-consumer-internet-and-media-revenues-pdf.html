  <h2>Commentary</h2>
  <p>For brands, the outsized role of advertising in industry growth implies that performance and brand budgets should increasingly favor ad-supported environments with robust reach and targeting. To protect and improve ROAS, marketers should double down on incrementality testing, MMM + MTA triangulation, and creative/format optimization within high-growth channels. The subscription-led rise in consumer spend suggests persistent pay willingness, but ad growth indicates scalable demand-gen opportunities; balancing acquisition (CAC/LTV discipline) with upper-funnel reach will be key. Measurement frameworks must accommodate mixed business models (ad- and sub-supported) and capture cross-channel lift to allocate to the fastest-growing segments reliably.</p>
